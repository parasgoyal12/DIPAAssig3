# Mini-Project in CS517 Digital Image Processing and analysis

Implementated the following techniques for Image Style Transfer Using Neural Networks:
1. Neural Style Transfer using VGG-16.
2. Perceptual Loss for Style Transfer using AutoEncoders.
3. A learned representation for artistic style using different normalization parameters in the style transfer network.
4. Exploring the structure of fast realtime style transfer using style prediction network.
